It all started with a message posted by a user of the My Digital Life forum – <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://forums.mydigitallife.net/members/acer-5100.1190204/">acer-5100</a> – about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://forums.mydigitallife.net/threads/discussion-patch-wmc-to-run-on-windows-10-final-possible-alternatives.61061/page-528#post-1783979">using Windows Media Center with H.265/HEVC channels</a>.</p><p>As you probably already know, due to internal Windows Media Center/DirectShow limitations, only MPEG1, MPEG2 and H.264 channels are supported and it's not possible to watch or record H.265/HEVC channels, even if you install the appropriate DirectShow codecs. Since WMC was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://localhost:4000/2018/10/07/highway-to-dll-hell/">abandoned by Microsoft many years ago</a>, it's extremely unlikely we'll ever see an update to make it compatible with HEVC channels.</p><p>To work around this limitation, acer-5100 opted for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://forums.mydigitallife.net/threads/discussion-patch-wmc-to-run-on-windows-10-final-possible-alternatives.61061/page-529#post-1784349">a simple but clever setup</a> that consists in combining DVBLink (and its IPTV source plugin) with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tvheadend.org/">Tvheadend</a>: by simply configuring DVBLink to use transcoded streams provided by Tvheadend rather than the original HEVC sources, Windows Media Center always gets a good old MPEG2 or H.264 video stream it can decode without any issue. Simple and clever.</p><span id="more"></span><p>When the French government announced a few years ago that terrestrial television in France would eventually move to DVB-T2 and adopt HEVC and AC4 as the new video and audio codecs, I imagined a similar – but slightly different – setup combining Tvheadend, the HDHomeRun BDA integration and an HDHomeRun emulator usable by Windows Media Center. Sadly, due to the COVID19 pandemic, the DVB-T2/HEVC/AC4 transition was postponed multiple times and the HEVC demo multiplexes never showed up in my region.</p><p>A <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lafibre.info/tv-numerique-hd-3d/tnt-uhd-en-france/12/">first DVB-T2 multiplex will be progressively deployed in most regions of France later this year</a>, but acer-5100's results were so promising that I decided not to wait for the DVB-T2 mux to be available to start testing these two options:</p><ul><li><p>I initially decided to give acer-5100's DVBLink-based approach a try: thanks to acer-5100, I was able to download the hard-to-find DVBLink 4.1 installer and managed to make the whole thing work after a few attempts. Unfortunately, the result wasn't great: it worked, but the channel switching delay was higher than my traditional setup and I was getting frequent <code>PlayReady update incomplete</code> errors that required switching to a different channel before switching back to the channel I wanted to watch (definitely not a great user experience!). After chatting with acer-5100, he confirmed he was also seeing similar errors from time to time. I tried a few other DVBLink versions, but each had its own issues (which surprised me quite a bit as DVBLink has always been a popular option amongst the Windows Media Center enthusiasts).</p></li><li><p>I then decided to give my variant a try: installing the HDHomeRun BDA driver was trivial as even the latest version worked absolutely fine. Once installed, all I needed was an HDHomeRun emulator to make the HDHomeRun BDA driver think it was communicating with a real HDHomeRun device: I initially opted for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/jfarseneau/antennas">Antennas</a>, but it wasn't recognized by the HDHomeRun setup utility, most likely because it doesn't emulate all the APIs it needs. I quickly gave up and tried the fantastic <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/dsaupf/HDHRProxyIPTV">HDHRProxyIPTV</a> instead: while it's no longer actively developed and not super easy to configure, it works just fine and is extremely stable.</p></li></ul><p>The <code>Tvheadend + HDHomeRun BDA + HDHRProxyIPTV</code> combo proved to be so good that I decided to experiment it on two machines – a Raspberry PI 3 with a Sony Play TV attached and Tvheadend installed and a Windows 10 machine with Windows Media Center set up - during a whole month.</p><p>After a month, the conclusion was clear: not only the channel switching times were comparable to my traditional setup (despite the additional IP latency caused by the use of Ethernet/PLC adapters), but it was also as stable as a physically attached tuner: <strong>the flexibility of DVBLink without any of the downsides</strong> 😎</p><p>I've since replaced the Raspberry PI by a more traditional x64 machine running Ubuntu Server with two Hauppauge WinTV-quadHD PCIe cards attached (as it will be much better at transcoding than a limited ARM SBC), but I haven't changed anything to the client part.</p><p>Given that I'm extremely happy with the result, I decided to write this post for those who would be interested in an alternative to DVBLink. While there's nothing terribly complicated, the whole process is of course much more elaborate than simply configuring a physically-attached TV tuner: if you're not willing to get your hands dirty, I would probably not recommend this option 😁</p><p>Still reading? Nice! Here's what we'll need for a complete setup:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Tvheadend</strong>, that will be used to manage the DVB-T(2) tuners, expose the DVB MPEG Transport Streams via its built-in HTTP server and – if needed – transcode the video streams.</p></li><li><p><strong>The HDHomeRun BDA driver</strong> that is part of the <code>HDHomeRun Software for Windows</code> package.</p></li><li><p><strong>HDHRProxyIPTV</strong>, for which you can find an already compiled x86 Windows executable in the GitHub repository of the project: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/dsaupf/HDHRProxyIPTV/tree/master/Release">https://github.com/dsaupf/HDHRProxyIPTV/tree/master/Release</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A way to inject the Tvheadend channels in Windows Media Center's database</strong>.</p></li></ul><h2 id="Install-and-configure-Tvheadend"><a href="#Install-and-configure-Tvheadend" class="headerlink" title="Install and configure Tvheadend"></a>Install and configure Tvheadend</h2><p>While alternatives exist – like the excellent <code>minisatip</code> – <strong>Tvheadend</strong> is by far the most flexible and user-friendly headend software.</p><p>Of course, nothing in this world is perfect and there's a downside: Tvheadend is not available on Windows, so you'll need a Linux machine (Tvheadend itself will work fine on Windows Subsystem for Linux or in more traditional virtual machines, but if you want to use a PCIe or USB tuner to receive terrestrial or satellite TV, it's surely going to be a painful process and the result might not be as stable as you'd expect).</p><p>Installing Tvheadend is quite easy, but the configuration part will differ depending on how you receive TV (e.g IPTV, DVB-T, DVB-C, DVB-S or a mix of multiple sources). If you're not familiar with Tvheadend, don't miss the tutorial written by the Pi Mylife Up guys: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-tvheadend/">https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-tvheadend/</a>.</p><p>Once everything is correctly configured, you should see the list of channels under the Configuration &gt; Channel/EPG &gt; Channels tab:</p><img src="/2023/07/05/connecting-windows-media-center-to-tvheadend-with-hdhrproxyiptv-an-alternative-to-dvblink/tvheadend-channels-list.png"><h2 id="Install-the-HDHomeRun-BDA-driver"><a href="#Install-the-HDHomeRun-BDA-driver" class="headerlink" title="Install the HDHomeRun BDA driver"></a>Install the HDHomeRun BDA driver</h2><p>For that, head to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.silicondust.com/support/downloads/">https://www.silicondust.com/support/downloads/</a>, download the latest <code>HDHomeRun Software for Windows</code> package and simply follow the installation wizard.</p><h2 id="Download-and-configure-HDHRProxyIPTV"><a href="#Download-and-configure-HDHRProxyIPTV" class="headerlink" title="Download and configure HDHRProxyIPTV"></a>Download and configure HDHRProxyIPTV</h2><p>An already compiled x86 Windows executable can be found in the GitHub repository of the project alongside the default configuration files: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/dsaupf/HDHRProxyIPTV/tree/master/Release">https://github.com/dsaupf/HDHRProxyIPTV/tree/master/Release</a>. Download the 3 files and store them in the same folder but don't start the executable yet.</p><p>Configuring HDHRProxyIPTV is the most complicated part, as there are two distinct files that need to be updated:</p><ul><li><p><code>HDHRProxyIPTV.ini</code>: it contains the <code>HDHRProxyIPTV</code> configuration and all the settings of the emulated HDHomeRun device. Most of the lines should be left as-is, but three options deserve a special attention:</p><ul><li><p>The device ID: a default device identifier is already present in the file so you don't have to change it. That said, if you plan on having multiple instances of <code>HDHRProxyIPTV</code> – for instance if you opt for installing it on each WMC machine as I did (instead of on a centralized server) – you'll need to use different device identifiers for each of your <code>HDHRProxyIPTV</code> instances to avoid collisions.</p></li><li><p>The number of tuners: by default, only 2 tuners will be created, but you can select up to 9 tuners (and not 8, as indicated in the file). It's worth noting that the number of virtual tuners exposed to WMC doesn't have to match the number of physical tuners attached to the Tvheadend machine: you can of course select a lower number, but also a higher value if you want to be able to record multiple channels of the same DVB multiplex (in this case, Tvheadend is smart enough to reuse the same physical tuner when the requested channels share the same DVB frequency).</p></li><li><p>The auto-start option: it is disabled by default but can be set to <code>1</code> if you want the emulated device to start automatically when the <code>HDHRProxyIPTV</code> executable is launched, which is very convenient if you add <code>HDHRProxyIPTV</code> to the list of programs that are started when opening your WIndows session.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><code>HDHRProxyIPTV_MappingList.ini</code>: it contains all the channels that will be accessible by the emulated HDHomeRun device. Each channel has a channel ID that you can set to any value you want and a virtual DVB-T frequency range. Here's an example of a mapping file containing 2 channels:</p></li></ul><figure class="highlight ini"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br><span class="line">27</span><br><span class="line">28</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="section">[MAPPING_LIST]</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">NUM_CHANNELS</span>=<span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="section">[CH1]</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">Channel</span>=<span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">LowFreq</span>=<span class="number">100001000</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">HighFreq</span>=<span class="number">100001000</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">Protocol</span>=HTTP</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">URLGet</span>=http://[IP address of your Tvheadend server]:<span class="number">9981</span>/stream/channelnumber/<span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">InternalPIDFiltering</span>=N</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">ExternalPIDFiltering</span>=N</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">Signal_Strength</span>=<span class="number">95</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">Signal_Quality</span>=<span class="number">90</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">Symbol_Quality</span>=<span class="number">100</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">Network_Rate</span>=<span class="number">20000000</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="section">[CH2]</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">Channel</span>=<span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">LowFreq</span>=<span class="number">100002000</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">HighFreq</span>=<span class="number">100002000</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">Protocol</span>=HTTP</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">URLGet</span>=http://[IP address of your Tvheadend server]:<span class="number">9981</span>/stream/channelnumber/<span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">InternalPIDFiltering</span>=N</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">ExternalPIDFiltering</span>=N</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">Signal_Strength</span>=<span class="number">95</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">Signal_Quality</span>=<span class="number">90</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">Symbol_Quality</span>=<span class="number">100</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">Network_Rate</span>=<span class="number">20000000</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>While the <code>HDHRProxyIPTV_MappingList.ini</code> file was designed to be edited by hand, it's a terribly boring and error-prone process as soon as you have more than a dozen channels, so we'll see how to automate its creation – and the registration of the corresponding channels in the WMC database – in a few minutes.</p><p>If you prefer creating this file manually, here's my recommendations:</p><ul><li><p>To keep things simple, use the Tvheadend channel number for the <code>Channel</code> line.</p></li><li><p>While you're free to use any value you want for <code>LowFreq</code> and <code>HighFreq</code> – including real DVB-T frequencies – it's a good idea to use a fake frequency that doesn't match the real frequency of the DVB multiplex the channel belongs to. I personally opted for a simple scheme: the first channel always starts at <code>100001 KHz</code> and we add <code>1 KHz</code> for each new channel. In any case, the actual value doesn't matter much, as we'll directly inject the channel details into WMC's database instead of performing an actual frequency scan.</p></li></ul><h2 id="Configure-the-HDHomeRun-device"><a href="#Configure-the-HDHomeRun-device" class="headerlink" title="Configure the HDHomeRun device"></a>Configure the HDHomeRun device</h2><p>For that, start the <code>HDHomeRun Setup</code> utility (make sure you start <code>HDHomeRun Setup</code> and not <code>HDHomeRun Config GUI</code>!).</p><p>Once started, <code>HDHomeRun Setup</code> should initiate a firmware update: of course, since the device is emulated, no actual update will happen, but <strong>don't cancel the process</strong>: just wait a few moments and the message will eventually disappear.</p><p>When it's done, ensure the source type of the tuners you want to enable is set to <code>Digital Antenna</code> and click <code>Apply</code>:</p><img src="/2023/07/05/connecting-windows-media-center-to-tvheadend-with-hdhrproxyiptv-an-alternative-to-dvblink/hdhomerun-setup.png"><div class="note tip"><p>Depending on the device ID you chose, the tuners might either appear as individual "sub-devices" or as a single, multi-tuner device: in both cases, things will work exactly the same way and the rest of the process will be identical.</p></div><h2 id="Prevent-mcGlidHost-from-scanning-channels-in-the-background"><a href="#Prevent-mcGlidHost-from-scanning-channels-in-the-background" class="headerlink" title="Prevent mcGlidHost from scanning channels in the background"></a>Prevent <code>mcGlidHost</code> from scanning channels in the background</h2><p>As we'll see in the next steps, all the channels we'll inject into the WMC database will share the same network ID, the same transport stream ID and the same service ID. The reason for that is actually simple: when Tvheadend extracts the elementary streams associated to a single channel – called Single Program Transport Stream (or <em>SPTS</em>) – from the Multiple Program Transport Stream (or <em>MPTS</em>) returned by the physical tuner for the requested multiplex, it doesn't preserve the network ID/transport stream ID/service ID of the original stream and sets all these values to <code>1</code>.</p><p>The downside with that is that if you leave Windows Media Center's automatic frequency scanning enabled (typically performed by the <code>mcGlidHost</code> process), it will end up merging all the channels as they'll be treated as the same DVB channel (which is logical as they share the same DVB identifiers).</p><p>While it's possible to create a Tvheadend MPEG-TS spawn stream profile calling <code>ffmpeg</code> to assign unique values to each channel stream (or restore the original values) (e.g <code>ffmpeg -i pipe:0 -f mpegts -mpegts_transport_stream_id 0x0006 -mpegts_service_id 0x0601 -metadata service_provider="SMR6" -metadata service_name="TF1" -c:a copy -c:v copy -hide_banner -loglevel panic pipe:1</code>), it's a very painful option as you need to create a stream profile per channel.</p><p>Instead, we're simply going to disable the automatic scanning feature to ensure WMC never ends up merging the channels we'll inject in the next step.</p><p>For that, apply the following registry changes:</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tbody><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Media Center\Service\BackgroundScanner]</span><br><span class="line">"PeriodicScanEnabled"=dword:00000000</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Media Center\Service\GLID]</span><br><span class="line">"DisableInbandService"=dword:00000001</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><div class="note tip"><p>Alternatively, if you don't want to use the over-the-air EPG and use your own EPG source (e.g Schedules Direct), you can disable <code>mcGlidHost</code> entirely by setting <code>DisableInband</code> to <code>1</code> under <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Media Center\Service\GLID</code>.</p></div><h2 id="Configure-the-HDHomeRun-tuners-in-Windows-Media-Center"><a href="#Configure-the-HDHomeRun-tuners-in-Windows-Media-Center" class="headerlink" title="Configure the HDHomeRun tuners in Windows Media Center"></a>Configure the HDHomeRun tuners in Windows Media Center</h2><div class="note warn"><p>If you configured your emulated HDHomeRun device to expose more than 4 tuners, you'll need to tweak WMC to be able to configure more than 4 tuners of the same type.

title="WmcChannels.zip">WmcChannels.zip</a>.</p><p>Using this program is trivial: run <code>WmcChannels.exe</code> and when prompted for the address of the Tvheadend server, enter the complete URL (e.g: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://192.168.1.25:9981/">http://192.168.1.25:9981/</a>).</p><p>If everything was correctly configured, the message <code>Done</code> should appear and a <code>HDHRProxyIPTV_MappingList.ini</code> file should be added to the current directory. Copy it to the folder containing <code>HDHRProxyIPTV.exe</code> and restart the emulated HDHomeRun device.</p><p>You can now launch Windows Media Center and confirm the added channels work fine
